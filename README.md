osric-cgi
=========

A CGI script for creating an OSRIC character sheet and spitting out the JSON.
This is intended to replace the previous project,
[osric-character-sheet-to-json](https://github.com/kirbyman62/osric-character-sheet-to-json).
It intends to walk the player through the entire character creation process,
and thus aims to be quite comprehensive.

Usage
-----

Just fill out the form on the website and it should give you JSON. Pretty easy.
It'll be hosted on iotek hopefully, otherwise on one of my Raspberry Pis.
